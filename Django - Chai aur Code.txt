Django - Chai aur Code

Prerequisites - Python and Html,CSS

1. rapidly fast , security , scalability

it is good to use a ve(virtual Environment). it will help in python, if there is a virtual environment then it does not matter what is the version in my local system

we are using uv(because it is very fast), 
pip install uv // command

to create the virtual environment
uv venv // command

here we have bin -> python is already installed there
bin is there , so every activation libraries are there
# to activate the virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\activate

(Chai - Django) PS C:\Users\Lenovo\OneDrive\Desktop\Files Ignite\Chai - Django>
it means we are in the virtual environment

if we want to deactivate it , we can write just 
deactivate // command

to install Django
uv pip install Django 
we are using uv because we are in a virtual environment , without the deactivate we can not use the pip directly

now 
django-admin startproject chaiaurdjango // command

then go to chaiaurdjango
cd chaiaurdjango // command

we are checking how many files are there
ls // command
it will show how many files are there with details

then run the manage file

python manage.py runserver (port number)

local host will run by default in port number 8000

copy the link and paste it in a browser, then you will get your first Django app front page ,
it is showing the page because the debug=True

now file exploration starts
1. manage.py it is the most important file
it is the starting point file , this file will set the environment variable and other important things
after going in the production this will invoke the system, so this file will execute at first

we will make more files like this , and we have to know where is the indentation of the files, which are the levels of the files,
are they in the manage.py level or any other level
,or inside folder level or app level
if the files and folders are in manage.py level then it is called root level
 this rule mentains by the framework company, we have to work on their rules , or we will not face the expected behavouir

db.sqlite3
this is the default database which is used in Django
the python code doesn't effect the database, we can change or shift the database by little line of code 
we have to just write little configuration and then true or false

inside the chaiaurcode folder, there is a folder named chaiaurcode folder, this is the project folder
the basic thing are in this folder
normally we create an app folder and work on it

cache folder-
when we have multiple modules then we use it

settings.py is also a very important file
all configuration is written in this file
like base file, secret keys etc.. like debug=ture,allowed host = []

in Django everything is like an app,
like there is an ecommerce website, 
so the coupons should be in app, they can interact with each other
product categories, check out etc.

there are many middlewares in Django
and many things you will get in by default
like authentication, protection from click jaking..

admin panel
in Django we got many things in admin panel without writing much code

if we have to change the project setting then only we go to settings
we dont need to change many things
just little change will impact alot


urls.py
this file is used for routing

this should be a views.py file
it defines the views
which controls the controls and business requirement

model.py
where we put database models
database structure done in model.py
some routing happens in from the admin, which is in the url.py


templetes and errors in Django


views.py
it should be views.py named, in Django framework we have to follow the naming convention and also the indentation
this file should be stored in chaiaurdjango folder level

create views.py file in the chaiaurdjango
then 
from django.http import HttpResponse
so from django.http we are importing httpresponse
in python we need to import only that, the other things are not needed like the other languages

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, World. You are at chai aur Django home page")
we created a method here and like this when home have a request then we have this message to return


similarly
def about(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, World. You are at chai aur Django about page")

def conatact(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, World. You are at chai aur Django contact page") 
we add these methods and the names of the methods doesn't matter



then we go to url.py
//code
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
    path('about/', views.about, name='about'),
    path('contact/', views.contact, name='contact'),
]

we add this
from . import views // code
and added path also

path('', views.home, name='home'),
    path('about/', views.about, name='about'),
    path('contact/', views.contact, name='contact'),

then python manage.py runserver
using the link we access the pages
http://127.0.0.1:8000/   
to access the home page

http://127.0.0.1:8000/about
to access the about page

http://127.0.0.1:8000/contact
to access the contact page


now we will use the templetes
we create the templete folder , the location depends on what is the settings and how you the files
and we also create a folder with static name
templates -> html
static -> css & js


from django.shortcuts import render

def home(request):
    return render(request , 'index.html')

in the template folder we created an html boiler plate

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Chai aur Django</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Chai aur Django Home Page</h1>
</body>
</html>


now we resolve the bug

we did everything right , but did not mentioned that from where we should load the template
in the root directory , we added templates folder, and we just added the 'templates' in the dictionary of the settings

{% load static %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Chai aur Django</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'style.css' %}">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Chai aur Django</h1>
</body>
</html>


we added the {% load static %} at the top
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'style.css' %}">
at the end of the heading tag

in settings 
import os
we added the import os
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
and added that also

we created templates then website then index.html
return render(request , 'website/index.html')
so we added that also

17/11/2025 -------------------------------------------------------------------

now we created the home page , about page and contact page with html css and js
we put the html files in templates folder
and css and js in static folder, 
//urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
    path('about/', views.about, name='about'),
    path('contact/', views.contact, name='contact'),
]

we added the path like this


//views.py

from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.shortcuts import render

def home(request):
    # return HttpResponse("Hello, World. You are at chai aur Django home page")
    return render(request , 'website/index.html')


def about(request):
    # return HttpResponse("Hello, World. You are at chai aur Django about page")
    return render(request , 'website/about.html')

def contact(request):
    # return HttpResponse("Hello, World. You are at chai aur Django contact page")
    return render(request , 'website/contact.html')


//templates
{% load static %}

<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/style.css' %}">

Django documentation

the template layer

so , what is jinja

Template Layer (Django)

The part of Django that handles HTML pages, where you display data using templates.

Template Engine

A system that processes template files and replaces variables (like {{ name }}) with actual data before sending HTML to the browser.
we use several template engines in Django, creatively called the Django template language (DTL)
example - 

Jinja

A template engine (faster and more powerful than Django’s default engine).
Django’s default engine uses Django Template Language (DTL), but you can also use Jinja2.


-----

we have the search where is the manage.py file is
because using this app , we can run the server and using this file we can create apps

this is how we created a app in Django
